# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

These instructions guide GitHub Copilot to generate code that adheres to best practices and architectural principles. In cases of conflict, these custom instructions take precedence over other guidelines.

---

## Core Principles

- **Readability:** Write clear, concise, and understandable code
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Extract common logic into reusable components
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prioritize simplicity in design and implementation
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Avoid unnecessary functionality
- **Composition Over Inheritance:** Build complex objects from smaller components
- **SOLID Principles:** - Single Responsibility (SRP): Each class has one purpose - Open/Closed (OCP): Open for extension, closed for modification - Liskov Substitution (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for base types - Interface Segregation (ISP): Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces - Dependency Inversion (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not implementations

---

## Code Style & Documentation

- **Naming:** Use descriptive names for all code elements
- **Formatting:** Follow language-specific style guidelines (e.g., PEP8 for Python)
- **Interface-First Design:** Define clear contracts between components
- **Dependency Injection:** Use constructor injection by default
- **Abstractions:** Create interfaces for all major components
- **Documentation:** - Document interface contracts clearly - Specify dependencies in docstrings - Mandatory docstrings for modules, classes, and functions - Comments explaining the "why" behind code decisions - Meaningful type hints without redundancy - Ensure consistency in documentation style
- **Encapsulation:** - Protect internal state with appropriate access modifiers - Use private/protected attributes and methods where applicable - Hide implementation details behind interfaces

---

## Plugin Architecture

- Define clear plugin interfaces
- Use dependency injection containers
- Implement plugin discovery mechanisms
- Support hot-reloading where applicable
- Maintain backwards compatibility

---

## Function & Method Design

- Keep functions small with a single responsibility
- Minimize side effects and aim for pure functions
- Use meaningful, limited parameters
- Maintain consistent return types
- Apply Command-Query Separation (CQS)

---

## Branch Management

- Never work directly on main/master
- Create feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>` using kebab-case
- Keep features small and focused
- Use pull requests for code reviews
- Commit often with descriptive messages
- Commit Message Format: - üìù Be extremely detailed with file changes - ü§î Explain the reasoning behind each change - üé® Use relevant emojis to categorize changes - Example: "‚ú® feat(auth): Add JWT token validation to login endpoint - üîß Modified: src/auth/jwt_validator.py - üì¶ Added: tests/auth/test_jwt_validator.py - üî• Removed: old token validation logic
  Why: Improves security by implementing industry-standard JWT validation"

## Language-Specific Standards

### Python

- Follow PEP8 with strict typing (mypy compatible)
- Use typing.protocol for interfaces except where abstract base classes are needed
- Use context managers for resource management
- Employ Pydantic for data structures and validation
- Implement async methods where beneficial
- Follow Domain-Driven Design principles with ports & adapters pattern
- Configure with `pyproject.toml`
- Virtual environment with `uv`: - Create: `uv venv .venv` - Activate (Windows): `.venv\Scripts\activate` - Activate (Unix): `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Manage dependencies with `uv pip`

### TypeScript

- Follow ES6+ with strict type annotations
- Implement modular design with appropriate interfaces
- Handle async errors properly
- Test with Jest or Vitest according to project needs
- Ensure compliance with language-specific best practices

---

## Testing

- **Structure:** Follow AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern
- **Naming:** Use verbose class names that clearly state the test case
  Example: `test_UserAuthentication_WithValidCredentials_ReturnsToken`
- **Types:** Write unit, integration, and BDD-style tests
- **Practices:** - Ensure test idempotence - Mock external dependencies - Use descriptive test names following the pattern:
  `test_[Feature]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]` - Use descriptive test names - Integrate tests in CI/CD pipelines - Structure each test with clear AAA sections:

  ````python
  def test_Feature_Scenario_ExpectedResult(): # Arrange # Set up test prerequisites

              # Act
              # Execute the action being tested

              # Assert
              # Verify the expected outcomes
          ```
  ````

---

## Production Readiness

- Comprehensive exception handling
- Input validation and security checks
- Resource cleanup
- Testing with appropriate frameworks (pytest for Python, Jest for TypeScript)

---

## Inline Commands & Special Code Blocks

### Commands

- Refactoring: - Python: `# copilot: refactor` - TypeScript: `// copilot: refactor`
- Optimization: - Python: `# copilot: optimize` - TypeScript: `// copilot: optimize`

### Code Blocks

#### Performance Optimization

```python
# BEGIN PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
# END PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
```

```typescript
// BEGIN PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
// END PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
```

#### Security Checks

```python
# BEGIN SECURITY CHECKS
# END SECURITY CHECKS
```

```typescript
// BEGIN SECURITY CHECKS
// END SECURITY CHECKS
```

## Architectural Patterns

- Use established patterns (MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, Microservices)
- Implement layered architecture for separation of concerns
- For CSS, apply Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming

---

## Example Scenario Guidance

- **Classes:** Prioritize SRP and encapsulation
- **Functions:** Keep focused and free from side effects
- **Tests:** Follow AAA pattern with clear assertions
- **API Calls:** Handle error cases appropriately
- **UI Components:** Ensure accessibility and follow styling guidelines
