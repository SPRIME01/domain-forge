# System Context Diagram

This document describes the system context diagram for the Domain Forge project using PlantUML with C4 diagrams.

Below is the PlantUML code to generate the diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Context.puml

' Define the primary person interacting with the system
Person(admin, "Administrator", "Manages the application", "Interacts with various systems to configure and oversee operations.")

' Define the core system
System(system, "Domain Forge", "Core domain-driven design platform", "Facilitates integration between domain experts and systems.")

' Define an external system dependency
System_Ext(externalSystem, "External System", "Provides external data", "Offers necessary data integrations and services.")

' Define relationships between elements
Rel(admin, system, "Uses", "Initiates tasks and monitors performance.")
Rel(system, externalSystem, "Integrates with", "Fetches and sends data as required.")

' Optionally, add more elements as the project scope grows

To generate the diagram, copy the above PlantUML code into a PlantUML-enabled environment or online editor like [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com/).

This diagram provides a high-level overview of:

- The primary actor (Administrator)
- The core system (Domain Forge)
- An important external system the core system interacts with

```

```
